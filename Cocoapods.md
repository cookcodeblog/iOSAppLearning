# Cocoapods

[Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) is used to manage package dependencies for iOS App development. It is just like Maven, Gradle or
npm, etc.

```bash
# Install Cocoapods

sudo gem install cocoapods

# Init
pod init

# Edit Cocoapods settings
vi Podfile

# Install dependencies
pod install

# Open Cocoapods Project
Open .xcworkspace instead of .xcodeproj file, to prevent can't find module problem.

# Run build
Click Run button to build the iOS App project in XCode.

```
